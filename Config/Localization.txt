lawnMowerTip,Journal Tip,,"Thanks for choosing Lawn Tractor Mod, brought to you by Zilox and ocbMaurice.
Extend the Lawn Tractor with modifiers, to make it a multipurpose farming vehicle. Without modifiers, it will mow down everything marked as a plant, including your own crops, so be careful when driving through your farm. It doesn't do any damage to anything else, if you don't bump into it. Harvested items, by various collectors, are put into the vehicle storage. Base vehicle recipes are unlocked by [CCFF99]Grease Monkey 3[-] or by finding or buying the schematics. [C0F030]Press F[-] to enable the mower blades, which switches alternating with the lights and uses fuel when enabled.\n\n[FFCC99]Grass Collector[-] ([CCFF99]Living Off The Land 1[-]): Collect plant-fibers from grass and wood from bushes. [FFCC99]Plant Collector[-] ([CCFF99]Living Off The Land 2[-]): Can harvest flowers and other small plants, like coffee or mushrooms. Yield is low, but you get at least a little bit. [FFCC99]Crop Harvester[-] ([CCFF99]Living Off The Land 3[-]): Can gather all sort of plants and crops. Yield should be good enough to sustain a farm. [FFCC99]Crop Protector[-] ([CCFF99]Advanced Engineering 2[-]): Protect your own crops from being mowed down. [FFCC99]Crop Reseeder[-] ([CCFF99]Advanced Engineering 4[-]): Use this mod together with Crop Harvester to fully automate your farm life. Seeds need to be put into the vehicle storage, as you will not get enough seeds back when harvesting."
